# Multiple-dataset-combined-dashboard
Created a combined dashboard from 2 datasets containing two charts.
1️⃣ 1st line chart showing the amount of CO² production in different regions in the shown time period at X-axis (line chart at bottom). Regions are shown with different colored lines.
2️⃣ 2nd map chart showing the average amount of CO² emitted per capita (map chart at top).
